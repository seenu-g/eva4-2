Examples of how to to do sentiment analysis https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis
nlp1.ipynb: load data, create train/test/validation splits, build a vocabulary, create data iterators, define a model and implement the train/evaluate/test loop.
nlp2.ipynb: 1 + using packed padded sequences, loading and using pre-trained word embeddings, different optimizers, different RNN architectures, bi-directional RNNs
nlp3.ipynb: 2 ~ different approach that does not use RNNs
nlp4.ipynb: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sentiment analysis
