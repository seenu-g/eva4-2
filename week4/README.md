### **Objectives**:

- Refer to this beautiful [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/finetune-a-facial-recognition-classifier-to-recognize-your-face-using-pytorch-d00a639d9a79). 
- Collect 10 facial images of 10 people you know (stars, politicians, etc). The more the images you collect, the better your experience would be. Add it to this [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz) dataset. 
- Train as in the blog and upload the FR model to Lambda
- Share the link to "that" single page. 
- Share the link to GitHub repo.
